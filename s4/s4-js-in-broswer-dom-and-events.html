/*
    DOM manipulation = technical term referring to making JS **interact** with a web page. If we change the DOM we change the webpage.

    DOM = Document Object Model. It is a structured representation of a HTML document, that can be used to connect webpages to scripts or programming languages, like JS.
      - each HTML element can be represented by a box
      - for each HTML 'box', there is an object in the DOM that we can access and interact with.

    JS and the DOM are two different things. We can use JS methods to interact with the DOM and change the webpage. Methods are functions attached to some object (in this case, the document object)

    GAME RULES:

    - The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
    - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
    - BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
    - The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
    - The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
