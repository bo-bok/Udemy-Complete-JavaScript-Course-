    /* *** 36. Lecture: The DOM and DOM Manipulation *** */

/*
    DOM manipulation = technical term referring to making JS **interact** with a web page. If we change the DOM we change the webpage.

    DOM = Document Object Model. It is a structured representation of a HTML document, that can be used to connect webpages to scripts or programming languages, like JS.
      - each HTML element can be represented by a box
      - for each HTML 'box', there is an object in the DOM that we can access and interact with.

    JS and the DOM are two different things. We can use JS methods to interact with the DOM and change the webpage. Methods are functions attached to some object (in this case, the document object)

    GAME RULES:

    - The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
    - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
    - BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
    - The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
    - The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

      - what an anonymous function is
      - another way to select elements by ID
      - how to change the image in an <img> element

    // events:
      //- notifications that are sent to notify the code that something happened in the webpage
      //- event listener: a function that performs an action based on a certain event. It waits for a specific event to happen

    // how are events handled:
      // an event can only be handled as soon as the execution stack is empty, aka, when all the functions have returned
      // message queue: in the js engine and where all the events that happen in the browser are put, and sit there waiting to be processed. Once called, as it's a function it gets its own execution context and goes to the top of the stack
